Don't skip or stop to add an api or ask some questions don't worry 
Just continue building till you finish it 
Make sure you finish it 
Add more to the filter stuff 
Location available is school gate, town, yemkem, iworoko, phase2, osekita 
Make chatbot more smart too
Show if a profile is untrusted 
Option to report seller giving notifications to both admin and seller
Also the site is somehow slow now 
Also people selling services maybe painter etc, should it be free or there’s a monthly subscription for them to post their thing maybe free
