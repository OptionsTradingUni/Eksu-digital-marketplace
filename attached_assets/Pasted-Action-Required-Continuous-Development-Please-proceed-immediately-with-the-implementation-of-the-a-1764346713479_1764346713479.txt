All required keys and configurations are already set up and accessible in the environment:

How to Fix the Resend Error
The solution is to change the from address in your application's code to an email address that uses your verified domain: eksuplug.com.ng.
1. Change the FROM Address:
• Go to the part of your application code that makes the call to the Resend API (likely within the createAndBroadcastNotification or related functions mentioned in the first log).
• Locate the from: parameter in the API call.
• Old (Failing): from: "christophermomsa@gmail.com" (or similar)
• New (Working): from: "no-reply@eksuplug.com.ng" or from: "info@eksuplug.com.ng" (Use any address that ends in @eksuplug.com.ng).
2. Ensure the Verified Domain is Used: If you are storing the sender email in an environment variable (like process.env.FROM_EMAIL), make sure that variable is updated to use your verified domain.
💡 Quick Recap of All Errors
Remember, you still have two other errors to address:

The layout in secret message and I’m not able to scroll easily or scroll to see more secret messages 

Please like I said whenever I click create your own link in secret messages it takes me to the start page or sign up page I don’t want that, let outsiders who are not signed to have direct access to the site and use it too 

When an action happen maybe link copied etc once it shows let it disappear 

I noticed that users in messing has disappeared from my messages conversation please solve it 

Also in my profile I see social links , services you offer , account security and settings 

Social links shouldn’t have the name social link 
Just in your edit profile be able to add TikTok, instagram link and very it is a TikTok instagram link 

Services you offer would be like a mini bio 

While for account security and settings let it fall under settings when you click the 3 dots 
Add the account settings in normal
Profile navigation and remove the account name from there and put it there 


Theme changing already exist but it’s not showing or persistent. It’s not showing in the site itself 
After sign up it’s not visible again 
Also remove the name or file darkmode in profile navigation since I’m not using it 

Error
500: {"message":"column \"titlel" of relation
"community_postsl" does not exist"}

As you’re creating anything create database tables with it 

Also in carting check if many products can be added to carts and purchase can be made 
In confessions I’m unable to add comments 

Also in filters I’m unable to scroll it’s fixed or stocked 
Also work on student materials and hostel finder stuff 

Also in campus update management I’ll be using that to send messages to people via the official account
