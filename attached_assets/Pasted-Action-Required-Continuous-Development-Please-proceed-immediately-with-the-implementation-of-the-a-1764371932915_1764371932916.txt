Action Required: Continuous Development

Please proceed immediately with the implementation of the attached issues report. Do not stop, skip steps, or ask for credentials.
Check and read all the issues and work on all of them 
All required keys and configurations are already set up and accessible in the environment:

Database: URL  are set.

APIs: Resend are all configured.

Your goal is continuous, uninterrupted work on the provided list of features and bugs. Prioritize implementation over setup. Let me know only when a task is completed.


Step 1: Deleting Old Email Logic
Go through your project files and delete or comment out any code that:
1. Imports or uses Nodemailer, nodemailer, or any library related to general SMTP/Gmail connections.
2. Contains hostnames like smtp.gmail.com or refers to Gmail passwords/credentials.
3. Defines the sender email as @gmail.com (e.g., christophermoms@gmail.com).
Focus on the files referenced in your error logs (index.js or related notification/email service files).
🚀 Step 2: Resend Setup (The New Code)
We'll define the required environment variables and the clean, dedicated Resend service code.
1. ⚙️ Environment Variables (.env file)
You must define these variables in your deployment environment (e.g., Render, where your app is hosted) and your local development environment (.env file).

Step 2: Resend Setup (The New Code)
We'll define the required environment variables and the clean, dedicated Resend service code.
1. ⚙️ Environment Variables (.env file)
You must define these variables in your deployment environment (e.g., Render, where your app is hosted) and your local 
development environment (.env file).

FROM_EMAIL The verified sender address.

system@eksuplug.com.ng

Also the email address you send too are email used for configuration or sign up 
When you’re done send a email using this to my email eksucampusmarketplace@gmail.com and toluchris95@gmail.com

📧 Dedicated Email Service File (e.g., emailService.js)
Create a new file (or overwrite your old email file) to contain only the Resend logic. This file handles the authorization and the API call.
// emailService.js

// 1. Import the Resend library
import { Resend } from 'resend';

// 2. Initialize Resend using the API Key from the environment
// The Resend constructor automatically looks for the RESEND_API_KEY environment variable.
const resend = new Resend();

/**
 * Sends a notification email using the Resend service.
 * It strictly uses the verified domain defined in RESEND_FROM_EMAIL.
 *
 * @param {string} to - The recipient's email address.
 * @param {string} subject - The subject line of the email.
 * @param {string} bodyHtml - The HTML body content of the email.
 * @returns {Promise<object>} - An object indicating success or failure.
 */
export async function sendNotificationEmail(to, subject, bodyHtml) {
    // CRITICAL: Get the verified sender address from the environment
    const fromEmail = process.env.RESEND_FROM_EMAIL;

    // Safety check to ensure the environment variable is set
    if (!fromEmail || !fromEmail.endsWith('@eksuplug.com.ng')) {
        console.error("🚫 RESEND_FROM_EMAIL is missing or invalid. Must use a verified domain!");
        return { success: false, error: "Missing or unverified sender configuration" };
    }

    try {
        console.log(`Attempting to send email from ${fromEmail} to ${to} via Resend...`);

        const { data, error } = await resend.emails.send({
            from: fromEmail, // <-- THIS IS THE FIXED SENDER ADDRESS
            to: [to],
            subject: subject,
            html: bodyHtml,
        });

        if (error) {
            console.error("❌ Resend send failed:", error);
            // The Resend error object will be returned to the calling function
            return { success: false, error: error };
        }

        console.log("✅ Resend email sent successfully. ID:", data.id);
        return { success: true, data: data };

    } catch (e) {
        console.error("🚨 An unexpected error occurred during Resend call:", e);
        return { success: false, error: e };
    }
}

Integration with Notification Logic (e.g., in index.js)
This is where you update your function (createAndBroadcastNotification) to use the new service.
// index.js (or wherever your notification function is)

import { sendNotificationEmail } from './emailService.js'; // Adjust the path as needed

// ... existing code ...

async function createAndBroadcastNotification(recipientEmail, notificationType, content) {
    // 1. Call the database function (This is where your 22P02 PostgreSQL error is)
    // await DatabaseStorage.createNotification(...);

    // 2. Broadcast the notification (using only the new Resend service)
    if (notificationType === 'EMAIL') {
        const subject = "Your New Notification"; // Customize subject
        const bodyHtml = content.html || "<h1>Automated Notification</h1>"; // Ensure you pass valid HTML/text

        const result = await sendNotificationEmail(recipientEmail, subject, bodyHtml);

        if (!result.success) {
            // Log the specific failure for debugging
            console.error(`[Email] Notification failed for ${recipientEmail}:`, result.error);
        }
    }
    
    // ... logic for other notification types (e.g., SMS, push)
}
