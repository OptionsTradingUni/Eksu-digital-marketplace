Anti-Scam & Trust Features That Actually Work on Campus Sites in Nigeria
1.  Mandatory NIN + Student ID Verification for Sellers
	•  To post anything above ₦10,000–₦20,000, seller must upload: – Clear selfie holding school ID card – NIN slip or BVN-linked phone number
	•  You verify manually at first (or use an affordable API like YouVerify, Dojah, or Smile Identity – starts at ₦30–₦70 per check) → Shows a big green “Verified Student” badge on profile and every listing → Scammers hate this; 95 % will leave immediately.
2.  Payment Holding / Escrow System (This is GOLD for students)
	•  Buyer pays into your platform wallet (via Paystack, Flutterwave, Monnify)
	•  Money is held until buyer clicks “Item Received & OK”
	•  Only then is money released to seller (minus your 3–6 % fee)
	•  If dispute → you mediate with photos/chat screenshots (takes 5 mins) → Students trust this 100 % because no one runs away with cash.
3.  “Meet & Pay on Campus” + “Dorm Delivery + Cash on Delivery” Options Give three choices when buyer contacts seller:
	•  Meet in person (default – safest)
	•  Seller delivers to buyer’s dorm → buyer pays cash/Venmo on delivery
	•  Pay through platform escrow (for people who don’t want to meet) → Covers every trust level.
4.  Automatic Scam Score on Every Listing
	•  New account + no profile photo + price 50 % below market → red flag
	•  AI + simple rules show “Low Trust – New Seller” warning
	•  Students ignore red-flagged listings 90 % of the time.
5.  Report & Instant Freeze System
	•  “Report Scam” button on every listing/chat
	•  Once 2–3 reports come in → listing hidden + seller can’t withdraw money until you review One-Click BVN Phone Verification (₦30 via Flutterwave or Paystack)
	•  When seller wants to cash out above ₦50,000, force BVN name match
	•  Takes 3 seconds and stops people using fake accounts.
9.  Seller Rating Locked to Real Identity
	•  You can’t delete your account and start fresh with 5 stars
	•  Bad rating follows the matric number forever.
10.  “Admin is a Student Here” Transparency
	•  Put the admin’s real name, department, photo, and WhatsApp on an “About” page
	•  Students trust a fellow student way more than a faceless app.
Bonus Nigeria-Specific Features That Students Beg For
•  USSD fallback (347…#) for airtime/top-up payments (many students have no card)
•  “Pay with Airtime” option (via ShareIT or Recharge2Cash API)
•  WhatsApp chat integration (button opens WhatsApp directly)
•  “Item reserved for 1 hour” timer so no double-selling drama
Recommended Launch Order (Minimum Viable Anti-Scam)
1.  Week 1: School email login + selfie + student ID upload
2.  Week 2: Paystack/Flutterwave escrow wallet
3.  Week 3: NIN/BVN verification for sellers above ₦20k items
4.  Week 4: Report button + manual freeze
With just these four things, your school marketplace will be the safest place to buy/sell on campus — safer than Jiji, safer than WhatsApp groups, and definitely safer than random Instagram sellers.
Students will spam their class groups with your link once they see the first “Verified Student” badge and escrow payment option.

Want me to give you the exact verification flow (screenshots + code snippets) or the escrow payment code using Paystack? Just say the word.


	•  You ban in <10 mins if obvious scam.
6.  Phone Number + Matric Number Visible After Chat Starts
	•  Once buyer messages seller, they see real phone number and matric number
	•  Scammers hate giving real numbers.
