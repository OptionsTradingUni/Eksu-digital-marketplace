COPY AND PASTE THIS TO YOUR DEVELOPER:
EKSU Marketplace - Bug Fixes & Improvements Task List
CRITICAL BUG #1: Payment System Broken
Error: relation "squad_payments" does not exist

Problem: The squad_payments table is defined in the code (shared/schema.ts line 509) but was never created in the production database.

Fix Required:

Run database migration: npx drizzle-kit push
Verify the table exists in Neon database console
Test a payment to confirm it works
CRITICAL BUG #2: Hostel Finder and Study Materials Not Visible
Problem: These features exist and work, but there are NO links to access them anywhere on the site. Users can only access via direct URL typing (/hostels and /study-materials).

Current State:

Route /hostels exists in App.tsx line 297-301
Route /study-materials exists in App.tsx line 292-296
Both pages are fully built and functional
MISSING: No links in navigation anywhere
Fix Required:

File 1: client/src/components/Header.tsx

Find the "Services" submenu (around line 206-227)
Add these menu items:
<DropdownMenuItem asChild>
  <Link href="/hostels" data-testid="link-hostels">
    <Home className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
    Hostel Finder
  </Link>
</DropdownMenuItem>
<DropdownMenuItem asChild>
  <Link href="/study-materials" data-testid="link-study-materials">
    <BookOpen className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
    Study Materials
  </Link>
</DropdownMenuItem>
Import BookOpen and Home from lucide-react
File 2: client/src/components/BottomNav.tsx

Currently only has 5 items: Home, The Plug, Messages, Games, Profile
Option A: Replace "Games" with a "More" or "Services" icon that opens a sheet with: Hostels, Study Materials, Games, VTU, etc.
Option B: Add a 6th item for "Services" that opens a quick menu
File 3: client/src/pages/home.tsx

Add a "Quick Services" section near the top of the page with clickable cards for:
Hostel Finder
Study Materials
VTU Data
Games
Secret Messages
CRITICAL BUG #3: Support Ticket Email Notifications Not Working
Problem: When users submit support tickets, the admin doesn't receive any email notification. Also, there's no way for admin to reply to tickets via email.

Current State:

Tickets are created and stored in database correctly
Admin can see tickets at /admin panel
But NO email is sent to admin when new ticket created
NO email is sent to user when admin replies
Admin can only reply through the website (no email reply feature)
Fix Required in server/email-service.ts:

Add two new email functions:

sendNewTicketNotificationToAdmin(ticket) - Sends email to admin when new ticket is created
sendTicketReplyNotification(ticket, reply, recipientEmail) - Sends email to user when admin replies
Update server/routes.ts:

In the POST /api/support route (line 2370-2383), add: call sendNewTicketNotificationToAdmin() after ticket is created
In the POST /api/support/:id/reply route (line 2416-2468), add: call sendTicketReplyNotification() after reply is created
Admin Email Reply System (Optional but Recommended):

Set up an email webhook (using Resend or similar) that receives replies to ticket notification emails
Parse incoming emails and add them as replies to the ticket
UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS
1. Create an Explore/Discover Page

New route: /explore
Shows all features in a grid with icons and descriptions
Categories: Marketplace, Housing, Education, Social, Services, Games
2. Improve Home Page Layout

Add "Quick Services" grid at top (before products)
Add "Featured Hostels" section
Add "Latest Study Materials" section
Keep "Products" section as main content
3. Better Empty States

When no products/hostels/materials found, show helpful illustration
Include "Create First Listing" button

Share to WhatsApp - Quick share buttons on products/hostels
Priority 2 (Nice to have):
