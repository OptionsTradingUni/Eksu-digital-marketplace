Subject: AGENT 2 – Your Complete Task List (Frontend + UI/UX + Anonymous Section)

Hi Agent 2,

You are responsible for EVERYTHING below. Complete 100%. No overlap with Agent 1.

1. Anonymous “Secret Messages” Section (Exactly like secretmessage.link)
   - Route: /secret or secret.eksu.digital
   - 100% public – NO login required at all
   - Full dark mode design
   - NO bottom navigation bar, NO header, NO “inside the app” feel
   - Anyone can view, post confessions, comment anonymously
   - Completely separate from main app

2. Fix Huge White Space on Mobile Load (100vh Bug)
   - Apply this CSS globally:
     html, body, .app, .page, [class*="container"] { min-height: 100dvh !important; min-height: -webkit-fill-available !important; }

3. Fix Keyboard Covering Input in Chats & Comments
   - Input bar must stick to bottom
   - Add padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)
   - Message list must scroll properly when keyboard opens

4. Comment Input Modal Appears in Middle → Change to Bottom Sheet
   - Must slide up from bottom like Instagram/TikTok

5. Product Browsing Page – Make It Exactly Like Jumia/Temu/Konga
   - Currently only 2 columns → make it 2–3 columns on mobile
   - Sponsored products at top + every 5–6 items
   - Add sections: “Sellers Near You”, “Sellers in Ado-Ekiti”, “Sellers in Ekiti”
   - Show seller location on profile and product cards

6. Gender Setting
   - Move from Settings → to Edit Profile
   - Fix slow switching

7. System Notifications
   - Currently white and ugly, don’t auto-dismiss
   - Make them colored (green/red), beautiful, auto-dismiss after 4 seconds

8. Dark Mode & Profile Screen
   - Dark mode toggle not working
   - Fix it fully
   - Rename to “Appearance” or “Screen Mode”
   - Or remove from profile and put in top navigation

9. Verification Badges
   - Normal verified users → blue check
   - Official Campus account → different (purple star or crown)
   - Sellers / Brands → different badge (gold ₦ or shop icon)

10. Category Filters
    - Add search bar inside the filter modal

11. Add any other UI/UX improvements you think will make the app feel premium and modern in 2025
