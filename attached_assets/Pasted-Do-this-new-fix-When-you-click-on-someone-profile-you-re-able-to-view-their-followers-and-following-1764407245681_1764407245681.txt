Do this new fix 
When you click on someone profile you’re able to view their followers and following 

Campus plug or official account doesn’t show followers and following only to the admin 

Use the favicon as pic for the official account 

Change the name Campus to Eksu Market Plug

Change need help to message the chatbot you can find it so so so or use the help or support button  in app 

Be able to copy messages 
Let messages be able to be deleted like WhatsApp 

When there’s a new message or anything let it show in notifications 

Also there should be like if I get a message it should show in my messages icon just like notification that 1 message received or looks like how cart icon looos like when there’s shopping 

When there’s an order messages get sent to email or when a seller or buyer reply they get notifications too 

Add pin feature for chats 
Since archive is in right put mark as read and pin in left 

Also let message box in the plug be like twitter 
It covers the whole page so keyboards won’t be dropping 
Also add media icon maybe at the top or just like this 
I only want the LAYOUT to become exactly like X/Twitter:
1.  Compose screen layout
	•  Top bar: Cancel (left) → Drafts (middle-right) → Post button (right)
	•  Avatar on the left, text area on the right
	•  Bottom line: globe icon + “Everyone can reply”
	•  Bottom icons row exactly like X (Media, GIF, Poll, Emoji, Location) + character counter + small + circle
2.  Add floating + button (bottom-right corner) that opens the compose screen
3.  Drafts feature
	•  When user clicks Cancel → auto-save the text as draft
	•  When compose opens again → load the draft automatically
	•  Show a small dot on the “Drafts” text when there is a saved draft
4.  Feed posts layout
	•  Each post must be a card with border-bottom only (same spacing as X)
	•  Avatar left, content right, exactly like X cards
Only change the layout and structure.
Just make the positions and arrangement identical to X.
Do it now, thanks!

Bro, fix this now:

1. Theme selection problem  
   - On the SIGN-UP / LANDING PAGE → keep ALL theme options visible (Light, Dim, Lights Out, Sunset, Ocean, Forest, etc.)  
   - After user LOGS IN → ONLY show the theme picker at the TOP navigation bar (like it is now)  
   - REMOVE “Dark Mode” and “Light” completely from the profile dropdown menu (the one that appears when I click my avatar)  
   → The profile menu should NEVER have any theme options again.

2. When user is logged in:  
   - The ONLY place to change theme must be the theme button at the top bar (the little moon/sun icon)  
   - That top theme picker should still have ALL themes (Light, Dim, Lights Out, Sunset, Ocean, Forest, etc.) — do not remove any  
   - But inside the profile sidebar/dropdown → delete “Dark Mode” and any theme switches completely.

Summary:  
Landing page = show all themes  
After login = theme change ONLY from top bar, NEVER from profile menu again.

Remove theme options from profile menu now. Thanks!

Also when I sign up, there’s no icon to input the email code it’s just saying resend etc 
Verification link is working, but I need an option where I can input code instead 

Also make sure registered emails can’t be registered again
