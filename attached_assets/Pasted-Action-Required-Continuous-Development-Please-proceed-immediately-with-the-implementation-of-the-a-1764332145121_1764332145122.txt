Subject: AGENT 1 – Your Complete Task List (Backend + Core Features + Payments)

Hi Agent 1,

You are responsible for EVERYTHING below. Complete 100%. No overlap with Agent 2.

1. Payment Fix – URGENT (Checkout is completely broken)
   - Current error: 503 {"message":"Payment service authentication failed","code":"INVALID_CREDENTIALS"}
   - I have pasted the correct Paystack/Flutterwave/Squad keys
   - My merchant account is still under review but dashboard gave live keys
   - Fix: Switch code to TEST MODE + use TEST KEYS immediately
   - Add toggle in admin panel: Test Mode / Live Mode
   - Make test payments work 100% first

2. Email Verification During Sign-Up (Currently Missing)
   - Right now user signs up with email → instantly logged in, no verification
   - Fix: After email entry → send 6-digit verification code/email
   - User MUST verify before full access
   - Unverified users: max 3 listings, cannot message, cannot buy, cannot post in plug
   - Show big banner: “Verify your email to unlock full features”

3. VTU / Data & Airtime Plans
   - Currently using hardcoded prices in files
   - Remove ALL hardcoded plans completely
   - Connect to real VTU provider API → fetch plans and real-time prices automatically
   - Cache for 10 mins if API fails

4. Official Campus Account (Campus Plug) – Full Upgrade
   - Add profile picture (use the current favicon)
   - Make it always show as ONLINE
   - Give it a special verified badge (different from normal users)
   - Make it SMART: when messaged → reply intelligently like a chatbot (use Grok/OpenAI API)
   - If user types “help”, “support”, “agent” → auto-create support ticket
   - Remove Follow/Unfollow button completely (everyone is auto-followed, don’t show in following list)
   - Messages from official account MUST trigger notification (currently not showing)
   - As admin → option to post as my normal account OR as official “Campus Plug” account
   - Campus-wide announcements → send via official account from admin dashboard

5. Block & Report System – Make It Actually Work
   - Currently blocking does nothing
   - Fix: When A blocks B →
     • All messages disappear from both sides
     • Profile shows blank / “This account is not available”
     • Cannot send or receive messages
     • Auto-unfollow both ways
     • Add “Blocked Users” list in settings

6. Hostel & Roommate Finder Feature
   - Implement fully with filters: price, gender, faculty, location, etc.

7. Search in Messages
   - Allow search by username AND message content

8. Follow Button Bug in The Plug / Campus Feed
   - Users I already follow still show “Follow” button
   - When clicked → says “Followed” but button still says “Follow”
   - Fix the state properly

9. Add any other backend, security, or admin features you think are obviously needed in 2025 for a campus marketplace
